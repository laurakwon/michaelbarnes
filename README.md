A fake persona project

Michaelbarnes.in fact is a website of a fake persona generated by the computer algorithm, collaborated with human, Sekyeong Kwon. This is a public platform to explore, speculate, and contemplate about future possibilities.

Michael Barnes is named after randomly chosen two words among fifty graphic designers who were featured in the book “I Used to Be a Design Student: 50 Graphic Designers Then and Now”. This project is a future speculation where computational intelligence/creativity and human meet. All of the texts apart from this statement are randomly generated using Python and Tracery writer from the data collected by a human. For the selected works of Michael Barnes, the blurbs are first written with Tracery writer, and then created by random art/design generators.

Are you afraid of robots taking over your job? Or do you still think the creative industry is safe from automation? This project starts with a question: Will AI/robots be an ally or enemy to designers? With these provocative questions, Michael aims to encourage people to start a critical communication about today's accelerating technology and its impact on the creative industry.
